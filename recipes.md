Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Grease a broiler pan with 1/2 tablespoon olive oil.

Step 2
Rinse chicken breasts and pat dry. Brush with remaining olive oil until coated. Sprinkle each piece evenly on both sides with paprika, lemon-pepper, and salt. Place on the prepared broiler pan, sprinkle garlic over top, and sprinkle onions around the base of the chicken, with several smaller pieces on top.

Step 3
Cook under the preheated broiler for 5 minutes. Flip and continue to cook, checking often, until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 5 to 10 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
